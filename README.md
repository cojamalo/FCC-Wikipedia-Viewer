# FCC-Wikipedia-Viewer
Completion Date: Oct 8, 2016

This is the repository for my completion of the freeCodeCamp "Build a Wikipedia Viewer" project. Formatted for mobile use.

A working version is at http://codepen.io/cojamalo/pen/ozZWER.
The project is an example of a simple AJAX request to Wikipedia's API. Helps the user quick see multiple search results.

Powered by the Wikipedia API. Project coded by Connor Lenio - released into the public domain for educational purposes in 2016. Uses Animate.css animations.
